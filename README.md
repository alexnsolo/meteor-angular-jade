!! COMPATIBLE WITH METEOR 1.2 and EARLIER

# meteor-angular-jade
Compile Jade templates for use in meteor-angular, with Angular 1.x.

### Prerequisites
For use with angular-meteor only. https://github.com/Urigo/angular-meteor

### Installation
```meteor add civilframe:angular-jade```

### Usage
Files ending in *.ng.jade and will be compiled to *.html

For example, "templates/directives/editUserForm.ng.jade" will be compiled to "templates/directives/editUserForm.html", so you'll want to reference it as such in Angular.
